# TOP-Landing-Page
Second big project from TOP, building a website completely from scratch following a given template. Will be using HTML and CSS

Update (Completed first two sections):
    - I don't know how the page is supposed to respond when resized so I just made it dynamic to make it look more fluid and proportional
    - The strinking only works up to a certain point, once it becomes really small the images start to break format
    Note: The font sizes look slightly larger, I'm not sure if thats supposed to happen
